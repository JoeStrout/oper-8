# OPER-8 CPU Specification

## Objectives

- 8-bit CPU suitable for use in fantasy computers/consoles
- simple design, easy to implement
- complete enough to be pleasant to program
- detailed docs, specs, and tests to help ensure all implementations are compliant

## Design Summary

**Architecture:**
- 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers (R0-R15)
- 2-byte fixed-width instructions: opcode byte + operand byte
  - instructions _must_ start on an even address
- 64K address space (16-bit addressing)
- Big-endian byte ordering
- Flags: Zero, Carry, Negative

**Key Decisions:**
- R0 is special only for zero-page memory operations (LOADZ, STORZ)
- Register pairs (Rx:Rx+1) form 16-bit pointers/values
- Register numbers wrap at 4 bits (R15:R0 is a valid pair)
- R14:R15 conventionally used as stack pointer (SP)
- Two-address instruction format (destination = first operand)
- Carry flag enables multi-byte arithmetic via ADC/SBC
- Input/output via PRINT and INPUT opcodes

## Total Opcodes: 38

This leaves significant room for future expansion (I/O ports, interrupts, etc.).

### Operand Byte Structure

**Two-register format** (most instructions):
```
[xxxx yyyy]
 Rx   Ry
```

**Single 8-bit immediate** (LDI0-LDI15, LOADZ, STORZ, JMP, etc.):
```
[iiii iiii]
 8-bit value
```
